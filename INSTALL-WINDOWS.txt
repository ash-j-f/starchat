		Edit the file "(Apache install directory)/Apache24/conf/httpd.conf".
		
			Add to the TOP of the file:
				LoadFile "C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/11/bin/libpq.dll"     <-- Or wherever Postgresql installed this DLL! Check it is there!
				AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .php
				AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .html
				LoadModule php7_module "(PHP install dir)\php7apache2_4.dll"     
					^^^^ NOTE: Make sure this DLL file exists at the specified location! If not then you have the wrong version of PHP.

					* NOTE: Replace "(PHP install dir)" with your PHP directory name eg: "C:\PHP7\".
		
			Make sure "index.php" is listed in the following "DirectoryIndex" block:

	Configure HTTPS/TLS/SSL:
	
		This process to configure SSL and obtain a site certificate is beyond the scope of this document. 
		To access this site in HTTPS mode, you must obtain self signed SSL certificates, or certificates issued by a certifying authority.
		Please see advice on Google for configuring an Apache hosted site to use SSL.
		
		Once SSL is configured, you must add the following HSTS security option to the Apache httpd.conf file:
			Find the section in the config file that looks like
				<Directory "${SRVROOT}/htdocs">
					Add this line directly under it:
						Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000"

			* Set Captcha on or off. Set it OFF for a localhost test "EnableCaptcha = false" or you will not be able to create accounts or log in.
			* Set superuser account names in the "SuperUser" list. Eg: "Ash,Bob". These users are the highest level global admins.
			
YOU CAN NOW CREATE ACCOUNTS AND LOG IN AT http://localhost/
